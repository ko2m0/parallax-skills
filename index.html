                            The song features Miller's virtuosic bass playing, as well as his sophisticated compositional
                             skills, and is widely regarded as a classic of the jazz-fusion genre.
                        </p>
                            <p>With its complex rhythm, harmonically rich chord progression, and soaring bass melody, "Tutu" is
                                 a tour-de-force of Miller's musical abilities
                                 and is considered one of the greatest recordings in the history of the electric bass.</p>
